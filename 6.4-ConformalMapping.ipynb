    "# General potential flows around bodies in 2D\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we looked at how we could assemble flows past\n",
    "bodies through superposition of singularities. That provided a\n",
    "nice way to understand the intuition of the solution. However,\n",
    "it turns out that there is a more elegant procedure for constructing\n",
    "the solution of potential flow around 2D objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure consists of two ingredients\n",
    "1. We solve the problem for a body in the shape of the unit circle (a circle of radius 1)\n",
    "2. We map that circle geometry into the actual geometry we desire\n",
    "\n",
    "If the mapping in step 2 is a **conformal transformation**, then the solution\n",
    "for the unit circle problem is guaranteed to be the solution for the\n",
    "actual problem. This is because conformal transforms preserve a lot of\n",
    "the important aspects of the flow, particularly the no-flow-through condition.\n",
